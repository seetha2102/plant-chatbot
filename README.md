🌱 Plant Chatbot – A Talkative Plant

An AI-powered chatbot that interacts with users using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide personalized plant care advice and monitor real-time plant conditions.

🔹 Features

✔️ Personalized Plant Care Advice – Recommends watering schedules, sunlight needs, and general care tips based on web-scraped data.

✔️ Plant Health Monitoring – Uses real-time environmental data (temperature, humidity, and light levels) to classify plant health as good, decent, or bad using fuzzy logic.

✔️ Watering Recommendations – Determines if a plant needs water based on weather API data (temperature, wind speed, and humidity).

✔️ Smart Plant Suggestions – Recommends suitable plants based on user preferences (indoor/outdoor, watering frequency).

✔️ Conversational AI – Built with Multinomial Naive Bayes & Neural Intents to classify user input and provide relevant responses.

✔️ GUI-Based Chatbot – Implemented as a Discord chatbot for easy user interaction.
